Premise: “Second Life”
	You’re a hero, your people’s champion. Tired of constant battles and wars, you are summoned to Amaranth—a hidden realm meant to be a safe haven for weary heroes.
But Amaranth’s founder Dr. Cosmos has become corrupted and taken over as the evil Calamitous. Now Amaranth is in need of its own hero.

Your goal is to gain enough power to face Calamitous and get your body back by nightfall—otherwise you will become one of the mindless Hero Sprites under his command.
As you travel through the 3 levels of Amaranth, you must face and defeat Calamitous's minions. Along the way, special power ups will be provided to you to aid you in
your quest.
